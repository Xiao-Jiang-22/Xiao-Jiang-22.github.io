Hi, I am Xiao Jiang!

I am a Ph.D. student in Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. I am broadly interested in medical imaging technologies, including system design and optimization, physics-based modeling, image reconstruction theory, and AI-driven imaging algorithms.

Currently, I conduct my research in the [AIAI](https://aiai.jhu.edu/) Lab at Johns Hopkins University, focusing on X-ray and CT imaging. I am supervised by [Prof. J. Webster Stayman](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/people/faculty/j-webster-stayman/) and collaborate closely with [Prof. Grace J. Gang](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p9660505) from the [IMPACT](https://www3.pennmedicine.org/departments-and-centers/department-of-radiology/radiology-research/labs-and-centers/quantitative/laboratory-for-imaging-physics-analysis-and-clinical-translation) Lab at the University of Pennsylvania.
