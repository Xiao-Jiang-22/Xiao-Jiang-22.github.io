excerpt: "Medical implants, often made of dense materials, pose significant challenges to accurate computed tomography (CT) reconstruction, especially near implants due to beam hardening and partial-volume artifacts. Moreover, diagnostics involving implants often require separate visualization for implants and anatomy. In this work, we propose a approach for joint estimation of anatomy and implants as separate volumes using a mixed prior model. We leverage a learning-based prior for anatomy and a sparsity prior for implants to decouple the two volumes. In addition, a hybrid mono-polyenergetic forward model is employed to accommodate the spectral effects of implants, and a multiresolution object model is used to achieve high-resolution implant reconstruction. The reconstruction process alternates between diffusion posterior sampling for anatomy updates and classic optimization for implants and spectral coefficients. Evaluations were performed on emulated cardiac imaging with stent and spine imaging with pedicle screws. The structures of the cardiac stent with 0.25 mm wires were clearly visualized in the implant images, whereas the blooming artifacts around the stent were effectively suppressed in the anatomical reconstruction. For pedicle screws, the proposed algorithm mitigated streaking and beam-hardening artifacts in the anatomy volume, demonstrating significant improvements in SSIM and PSNR compared with frequency-splitting metal artifact reduction and model-based reconstruction on slices containing implants. The proposed mixed prior model coupled with a hybrid spectral and multiresolution model can help to separate spatially and spectrally distinct objects that differ from anatomical features in single-energy CT, improving both image quality and separate visualization of implants and anatomy."
