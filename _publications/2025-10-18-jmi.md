excerpt: "Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is the gold standard modality for diagnostics and guidance for interventional procedures. Spectral imaging has previously been explored for DSA, but severe noise amplification from material decomposition has impeded clinical adoption. We present a novel joint processing strategy that leverages both temporal and spectral information for material decomposition to address this issue. We develop a model-based material decomposition approach that utilizes the pre- and post-contrast images simultaneously for material estimation. Performance was evaluated on a small-vessel phantom on a test bench with a photon-counting detector. Joint processing was compared with temporal subtraction and previously proposed spectral DSA techniques including hybrid subtraction and conventional three-material decomposition. Additional simulation was performed to investigate performance with perfectly calibrated spectral response and sensitivity to patient motion. The improved conditioning of the proposed method effectively reduces bias and noise in the spectral results and allows three-material decomposition with dual-energy spectral measurements. The method achieved more than an order of magnitude variance reduction compared to previously proposed spectral DSA techniques. Compared to temporal subtraction, a mean variance reduction of 23.9% was achieved in simulation and 10.8% in experimental data. The degree of reduction is object-dependent. Noise reduction achieved in physical experiments is slightly lower than that in simulation, likely due to bias from imperfect spectral calibration. The method is equally sensitive to motion compared to temporal subtraction. The proposed method addresses a major image quality challenge limiting previous approaches and outperforms temporal subtraction. Such improvements facilitate the clinical translation of spectral angiography."
